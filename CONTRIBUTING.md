# Contributing to opencode-prompt-logger

Thank you for considering contributing to opencode-prompt-logger! Before diving in, please read these guidelines carefully.

## Before You Write Any Code

**Open an issue first.** For anything beyond a small bug fix, typo, or documentation improvement, please open an issue and wait for a response before writing code. This can save you hours of work on something that won't be merged.

If an issue already exists, comment on it to signal your intent so work isn't duplicated.

## Pull Request Size

**Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern.**

- **Target under ~300 lines changed** (excluding lock files and generated code)
- **One PR = one thing.** Don't bundle a bug fix with a refactor with a new feature
- If your change is naturally large, break it into a chain of smaller PRs

PRs that are too large to review efficiently will be asked to be split.

## Prerequisites

- **Bun** (installed globally) — see [bun.sh](https://bun.sh)

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opencode-prompt-logger.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/description-of-fix
   # or
   git checkout -b feat/description-of-feature
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
5. **Make your changes** and validate before pushing:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck && bun test
   ```
6. **Push and open a PR** against the `main` branch, filling in the PR template completely.

## Response Time Expectations

Reviews may take a few days depending on availability. A PR sitting without a response is not a rejection. Please feel free to leave a polite ping after a week if there's been no activity.

## Thank You

Every contribution makes a real difference. Thank you for taking the time to improve opencode-prompt-logger.
